# AP Portfolio Vue 2020

A **previous version** of my portfolio website, built with **Vue.js**. This project showcases my past work and experiments in frontend development.

## Features
- **Built with Vue.js** – A simple and efficient SPA (Single Page Application).
- **Custom Styling** – Uses Vue's ecosystem for UI design.
- **Static Hosting Ready** – Can be deployed as a static site.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- This project **requires Node.js 16** to run properly.
- Vue dependencies are **outdated**, so it may be difficult to install and run without updating packages.
